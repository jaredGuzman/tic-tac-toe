# tic-tac-toe

Simple little Tic Tac Toe game playable in the browser. You can find the page it's hosted on ☀️ [here](https://jaredguzman.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) ☀️

You can choose between either 1 player mode or two player mode, and optionally set your name and the marker you want to use for the game.

## What this project features

* Player optional markers and names. In 2 player mode, both players can set their names and markers to whatever they'd like. In 1 player mode, the computer's name is automatically set to `Computer`.
* An implementation of the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to make the computer unbeatable. If playing against the computer, you will only either lose to the computer or tie.

## What I learned

* Planning and separation of interests is vitally important when completing complex tasks. My code is still not perfect, but in order to make the jump from relying on "X's" and "O's" for distinguishing between the players to allowing the players to choose their own mark would have been much, **much** easier if I planned for it in the beginning.
* Implementing complex algorithms is **hard**. This was only a simple taste of it, using a fairly well known algorithm in a fairly well known setting and even then it was a complicated thing to pull off.
